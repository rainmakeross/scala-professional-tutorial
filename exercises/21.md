# Exercise 21 > Use Match Expressions

- Definition: A trip between two stations is a short trip, if

  - there exists a connection with a single train and
  - there is at most one station between the given two

- Add an `isShortTrip` method to `JourneyPlanner`

  - Add `from` and `to` parameters of type `Station`
  - Return `true` if there exists a `Train` in `trains` where `stations`
    contain `from` and `to` with at most one other `Station` in between
  - Hint: Use the collection methods `exists` and `dropWhile` and a
    match expression with the sequence pattern

- Use the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.

- Use the `nextExercise` command to move to the next exercise.
