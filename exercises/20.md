# Exercise 20 > Use a Trait

- Mix the `Ordered` trait into `Time`

  - `Ordered` is part of the standard library; look it up in the API docs
  - `Ordered` defines concrete operators like <, <=
  - `Ordered` also declares an abstract method which you have to define

- Use the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.

- Use the `nextExercise` command to move to the next exercise.
