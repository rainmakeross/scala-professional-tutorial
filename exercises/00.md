# Exercise 0 > Initial State

Before we begin coding, we want to verify that the initial state is working as
expected. From your `sbt` session: 

- Use the `test` commands that your initial state is set-up correctly. 
You should see the following:

```scala
man [e] > scalatrain > initial-state > test
[info] Updating exercise_000_initial_state...

[info] All tests passed.

```

- Use the `nextExercise` command to move to the next exercise.
