# Exercise 8 > Use Packages

- From now on we will use specific packages

- Move the `Time` and `Train` classes to the `com.rainmakeross.training.scalatrain`
  package

    - Either use the "Refactor > Move..." wizard

    - Or add the package clauses manually and move the files to the
      `com/lightbend/training/scalatrain` sub directory of `src/main/scala`

- Create a `Time` in the REPL
