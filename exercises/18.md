# Exercise 18 > Override toString

- As `Time` is a case class, `toString` already looks quite good

- But we can do better and return something like 09:30

- Override `toString` with `lazy val`

- Use the `format %02d` for `hours` and `minutes`

- `%02d` means format the integer with 2 digits, left padding it with zeroes
